This repository is a fork of the [JUCE 5 develop branch](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE) with additions that enable it to generate [ARA plugins](https://www.celemony.com/en/service1/about-celemony/technologies) in the VST3 or AudioUnit format.
It is currently being maintained by [Celemony](https://www.celemony.com) and [SoundRadix](https://www.soundradix.com), with the goal of being picked up eventually by [ROLI](https://www.juce.com) for main line JUCE.

The ARA related changes are described in detail [here](https://github.com/Celemony/JUCE_ARA/blob/develop/JUCE_ARA.md).
For feedback and questions, please contact Celemony via [ara@celemony.com](mailto:ara@celemony.com?Subject=JUCE%20ARA%20integration).

# The JUCE 5 Library

**BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING ANY PART OF THE JUCE LIBRARY, YOU AGREE
TO THE [JUCE 5 END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://www.juce.com/juce-5-licence)
AND [JUCE 5 PRIVACY POLICY](https://www.juce.com/juce-5-privacy-policy), WHICH
ARE BINDING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN YOU AND ROLI, LTD. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE

JUCE is an all-encompassing C++ framework for developing cross-platform
software. JUCE is used by hundreds of companies to develop powerful,
cross-platform audio, interactive, embedded or graphic applications.

We now have tier-leveled license terms for JUCE 5, with different terms for
each available license: JUCE Personal (for developers or startup businesses
with revenue under 50K USD "Revenue Limit"; free), JUCE Indie (for small
businesses with under 200K Revenue Limit; $35/month), JUCE Pro (no Revenue
Limit; $65/month), and JUCE Educational (no Revenue Limit; free for bona fide
educational institutes). All licenses allow you to commercially release
applications so long as you do not exceed the Revenue Limit and pay applicable
Fees. Once your business hits the Revenue Limit for your JUCE license, you will
either have to upgrade your JUCE license or release your Applications under the
[GNU General Public License v.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html),
which means, among other things, that your code can be freely copied and
distributed.

You agree to give notice to the end-users of your Applications that we may
track the IP addresses associated with their use of the Applications using JUCE
solely for our internal purposes in providing JUCE, unless you are a paying
JUCE customer and opt-out of such tracking. You agree to fully comply with all
laws, including relating to the collection of information from children and the
[Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule).

JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework used for rapidly
developing high quality desktop and mobile applications, including VST, AU (and AUv3),
RTAS and AAX audio plug-ins. JUCE can be easily integrated with existing projects or can
be used as a project generation tool via the [Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer),
which supports exporting projects for Xcode (macOS and iOS), Visual Studio, Android Studio,
Code::Blocks, CLion and Linux Makefiles as well as containing a source code editor and
live-coding engine which can be used for rapid prototyping.

## Getting Started
The JUCE repository contains a [master](https://github.com/weareroli/JUCE/tree/master)
and [develop](https://github.com/weareroli/JUCE/tree/develop) branch. The develop branch
contains the latest bugfixes and features and is periodically merged into the master
branch in stable [tagged releases](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE/releases)
(the latest release containing pre-built binaries can be also downloaded from the
[JUCE website](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce)).

The repository doesn't contain a pre-built Projucer so you will need to build it
for your platform - Xcode, Visual Studio and Linux Makefile projects are located in
[extras/Projucer/Builds](/extras/Projucer/Builds)
(the minumum system requirements are listed in the __System Requirements__ section below).
The Projucer can then be used to create new JUCE projects, view tutorials and run examples.
It is also possible to include the JUCE modules source code in an existing project directly,
or build them into a static or dynamic library which can be linked into a project.

For further help getting started, please refer to the JUCE
[documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) and
[tutorials](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials).

## Minimum System Requirements
#### Building JUCE Projects
- __macOS__: macOS 10.11 and Xcode 7.3.1
- __Windows__: Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2013 64-bit
- __Linux__: GCC 4.8

#### Deployment Targets
- __macOS__: macOS 10.7
- __Windows__: Windows Vista
- __Linux__: Mainstream Linux distributions
