# JUCE and the ARA API

This repository is a fork of the [JUCE 5 develop branch](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE) with additions that enable it to generate [ARA plugins](http://www.celemony.com/en/service1/about-celemony/technologies) in the VST3 format (AU coming soon.)

In order to use this branch you'll need access to the [ARA SDK](http://www.celemony.com/en/service1/about-celemony/technologies) - if you're a developer and would like access to the latest ARA SDK release, send an email to [ara@celemony.com](mailto:ara@celemony.com?Subject=JUCE%20ARA%20integration). 

Current ARA SDK compatibility version: 1.9.6.002

For feedback and questions, please contact Celemony via [ara@celemony.com](mailto:ara@celemony.com?Subject=JUCE%20ARA%20integration).

### Getting started:

We've made modifications to the Projucer to enable it to work with the ARA 2.0 SDK. As of now the Projucer can be used to generate VST3 plugins that can be used as ARA plugins in a supporting host. 

To create an ARA plugin, clone the [ARA branch](https://github.com/Celemony/JUCE_ARA/tree/ARA) of this repository and build the [Projucer](https://github.com/Celemony/JUCE_ARA/tree/ARA/extras/Projucer)(projects for Visual Studio and Xcode exist within the repository.)

Once you have the ARA version of the Projucer built you can use it to specify your global ARA path like so:

This ARA SDK path will be used for new ARA plugin projects, but can also be configured per project. 

Once the SDK has been located we can create a new Audio Plug-In project like so

We specifically want to create an ARA plugin. This is not one of the main types in the template window but can be selected like so:

The generated plugin will have, in addition to the standard PluginProcessor and PluginEditor classes, a PluginARADocumentController file containing a class that overrides the ARA::PlugIn::DocumentController type.

This version of the Projucer only supports VST3, so make sure that format is checked in the settings

We can also edit other ARA plugin factory properties such as available content types and transformation flags as well as the plugin factory identifier.

This should be enough to generate an empty ARA plugin. For a more complete example see the [.jucer file located here](https://github.com/Celemony/JUCE_ARA/tree/ARA/examples/ARA).

JUCE is an all-encompassing C++ framework for developing cross-platform
software. JUCE is used by hundreds of companies to develop powerful,
cross-platform audio, interactive, embedded or graphic applications.

We now have tier-leveled license terms for JUCE 5, with different terms for
each available license: JUCE Personal (for developers or startup businesses
with revenue under 50K USD "Revenue Limit"; free), JUCE Indie (for small
businesses with under 200K Revenue Limit; $35/month), JUCE Pro (no Revenue
Limit; $65/month), and JUCE Educational (no Revenue Limit; free for bona fide
educational institutes). All licenses allow you to commercially release
applications so long as you do not exceed the Revenue Limit and pay applicable
Fees. Once your business hits the Revenue Limit for your JUCE license, you will
either have to upgrade your JUCE license or release your Applications under the
[GNU General Public License v.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html),
which means, among other things, that your code can be freely copied and
distributed.

You agree to give notice to the end-users of your Applications that we may
track the IP addresses associated with their use of the Applications using JUCE
solely for our internal purposes in providing JUCE, unless you are a paying
